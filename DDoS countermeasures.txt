# Layer 4 / Network level countermeasures
Disable all unused ports
Block unnecessary protocols (i.e. ICMP)
Filter ingress traffic -> reputation based blocking
Implement "blackholing" or "tarpitting"
	- Terminate traffic upstream of the origin server
 	- No response is sent, the traffic just "disappears"
Only works if the network isnt saturated with data -> use anycast nodes

# Layer 7 / Application level countermeasures
Dedicated devices such as a WAF can inspect HTTP traffic - make sure they can also inspect HTTPS traffic
Minimize the attack surface area:
	-Take anything that doesn't have to be public off that network segment
	-Place them within a private subnet

Design the application for DDoS resilient
	-Sandbox application features, ie: separate login, shop, search and report -> parts that cause a lot of overhead

Prepare yourself:
Implement a DoS strategy well in advance of an attack
	- Some defenses can have long lead-times to implement

Use legitimate stress test services
